title: BadUSB With a Digispark

## Intro

Bad USB is a term used when referring to a modified USB device that when connected to a computer, will act as a HID (Human Interface Device), like a keyboard. With the new "keyboard" installed in the system, it will simulate keystrokes in order to run pre-programmed malicius commands.

This type of attack became very popular with the release of [Rubber Ducky](https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe), a Hak5 product that does exactly what i mentioned above.

Despite being an excellent product, isn't the cheapest "toy" a hacker can afford, costing $44.99 dollars. If you don't leave in the USA like me, add some more $$$ due to taxes.
